pam_exec module:
	Call <prog> <arguments>


USAGE:
        For the services you wish to run a program put the following
	line in the config as the last line for that service:

        <type>    required     pam_exec.so [options] /path/prog ...

	and pam_exec.so will run "/path/prog ...".


OPTIONS:

	debug		print debug informations

	seteuid		pam_exec.so will call setuid(seteuid()), so that
			the program will run with the same rights as the 
			calling applications (effective user ID). The
			default is that the program will be run with the
			permissions of the calling user (real user ID).

	log=<file>	the output is appended to this file.
