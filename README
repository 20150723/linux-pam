Hello!

Thanks for downloading Linux-PAM.

NOTES:

This is the evolving autoconf branch for Linux-PAM. It is supposed to
be equivalent to Linux-PAM-0.72.

How to use it is as follows:

      ./configure --help | less
      ./configure <your-options>
      make

  Note, this is all experimental so you may not want to do this one..(?)

      make install

Please report problems to me:
